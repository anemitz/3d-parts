Center console replacement for Cirrus Sr22 G5/G6 which supports O2D2's.

* Single or dual O2D2 configuration. When used with a single O2D2 you gain additional storage via a modular storage cubby.
* 2 wire slits are located at the rear of the console to allow the use of the audio jacks on the bottom of the O2D2 units.
* Plugs are provided to cover up the unused oxygen tube hole when using a single O2D2.

** Note: **
1. I hid my O2D2 EDS regulators underneath the console and out of the way. This assumes you’ve routed your oxygen tubing similar to https://forum.cirruspilots.org/t/decluttering-cables-tubes/235399/54 

2. Mountain High only certifies the EDS up to a 48" tube length from the O2D2. This is too short for rear seat users so I made some extensions (about 18" in length) using 6mm union connectors. I’ve tested this on the ground and I didn’t notice a difference in O2 delivery via the extension but YMMV.

3. If you run dual O2D2s you may find that the fit is tight. Just place both O2D2 unit’s into the front component first and then slide it into the aircraft’s center console at an angle lightly spreading the sides apart. If you need to replace an O2D2 unit, first remove the rear storage component and use a finger to coax the O2D2 up and out replacing the storage component when done.
