Center console replacement for Cirrus Sr22 G5/G6 which supports O2D2's.

* Single or dual O2D2 configuration. When used with a single O2D2 you gain additional storage via a modular storage cubby.
* 2 wire slits are located at the rear of the console to allow the use of the audio jacks on the bottom of the O2D2 units.
* Plugs are provided to cover up the unused oxygen tube hole when using a single O2D2.
